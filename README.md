# ClassBuzz  
**Academic Source Code & Course Materials Repository**

ClassBuzz is a public educational repository for sharing source codes, session materials, and course resources used in university and institute-level classes.

The repository is actively maintained and structured to support:

## Purpose of This Repository

ClassBuzz is designed to function as:

- A shared source code hub for classroom teaching
- A session-by-session archive of course materials
- A reference repository for reviewing previous semesters
- A base structure for an academic documentation website

This repository grows along with the classes that use it.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized **hierarchically** for better navigation.

### Planned Directory Structure

/ClassBuzz/
<br/>└── SemesterCode/
<br/>└── UniversityNameCode/
<br/>└── CourseCode/
<br/>└── SessionDate/
<br/>└── Files


---

### Directory Naming Conventions

#### `/SemesterCode`
Folder for academic semesters.

Examples:
<br/>/Fall2025
<br/>/Spring2026

---

#### `/UniversityNameCode`
Subfolders representing universities or institutes.

Examples:
<br/>/GHU → Gharjistan University
<br/>/Kateb → Kateb University

---

#### `/CourseCode`
Course-specific folders with detailed identifiers.

Example:
/CS-CPP1-Night-GC

Meaning:
- **CS** → Computer Science faculty  
- **CPP1** → C++ Programming (Group / Level 1)  
- **Night** → Night classes  
- **GC** → Internal course or group code  

This flexible naming allows precise distinction between parallel classes.

---

#### `/SessionDate`
Each class session is stored in a folder named by date.

Example:
/14040404

Each session folder may contain:
- Source code
- Slides
- PDFs
- Assignments
- Notebooks
- Notes
- Supplementary resources

---

## Previous Courses Archive

Materials from previous terms or legacy structures are stored in:

/courses/

These folders are preserved for:
- Reference
- Self-study
- Historical comparison
- Curriculum documentation

---

## License

Unless otherwise specified, materials are shared for **educational and non-commercial use**.

Individual folders or projects may contain their own licenses.
